Warnings
========

The Universal House of Justice sent a letter dated 10 July 2014 to the Bahá'ís
of the World indicating a change to the Badí' Calendar. Tehran, Iran was set as
the point at which the Vernal Equinox and the sunset before it will be observed
thus starting the beginning of each Bahá'í year. They did not provide exact
coordinates. 



In number 35 of “Questions and Answers”, which is supplementary to the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh responds to a question concerning Naw-Rúz and
states: “The Festival of Naw-Rúz falleth on the day that the sun entereth the
sign of Aries”. This phenomenon coincides with the moment of the verbal equibox
in the northern hemisphere. Thus, the Festival of Naw Rúz falls on the day on
which the vernal equinox occurs, and that day, 1 Bahá, according to the Badí‘
calendar, starts at subset on 19 ‘Alá’ and ends at the following subset, which
marks the beginning of 2 Bahá.

The House of Justice made certain decisions, including the selection of the
specific spot in Ṭihrán used to determine the moment of the vernal equinox,
that made it possible to calculate the Badí‘ dates for a fifty-year period. A
table containing these dates was provided to the Bahá’í world in 2014. When
that fifty-year period draws to a close, the House of Justice will again make
the necessary decisions to extend the calculation of the Badí‘ dates into the
future. Naturally, then, any algorithm designed to project the specification of
these dates may well reach a faulty conclusion if the parameters on which it is
based deviate from the criteria set by the House of Justice.
