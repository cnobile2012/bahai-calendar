Baha'i Calendar
***************

An implementation of the Baha'i Calendar from Calendrical Calculations --
The Ultimate Edition 4th Edition.

To give credit where credit is due much thanks to Edward M. Reingold and Nachum
Dershowitz for giving me permission to use their code as a base line to my
Python code. You will find snippets of their original LISP code plus other
comments of explanation from their book in the comments in my code.

Much of the code is also derived from Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus.

This code will eventually be an implementation of library code similar to
the datetime package that comes with standard Python but for the Badi calendar.
