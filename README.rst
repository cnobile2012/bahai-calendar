An implementation of the Baha'i Calendar from Calendrical Calculations --
The Ultimate Edition 4th Edition.

To give credit where credit is due much thanks to Edward M. Reingold and Nachum
Dershowitz for giving me permission to use their code as a base line to my Python
code. You will find snippets of their original LISP code plus other comments of
explanation from their book in the comments in my code.
